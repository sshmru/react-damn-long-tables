idea
should accept collection and mapper OR children?

collection with mapper needs to call map on each scroll
(possibley slow if complex mapper)

children need to be mapped at the start
(possible delay)

how about memoize map !?(what about updates)

------

styling - for now it needs precise height in px or parent with set size
